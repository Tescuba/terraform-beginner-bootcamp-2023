    <p>The Eritrean marine resources are vastly distributed within the long coast and</p>
    <p>below the beautifully and carefully preserved sea. As a continuation to the first </p>
    <p>part of Eritrea’s marine resources, this section gives details about the coral reefs,</p> 
    <p>bird life, sea turtles, vegetation, tourism prospects and more.</p>
    <p>Marine experts say that coral reefs are shallow tropical water ecosystems largely</p>
    <p>restricted to areas between 30°N and 30°S latitudes. Coral reefs rank among the most</p>
    <p>biologically productive and diverse of all natural ecosystems. Living coral reefs support</p>
    <p>thousands of species including crustaceans, fishes, sponges, algae and molluscs. </p>
    <p>For centuries coral reefs have formed a vital component of coastal economies in many tropical countries.</p>
